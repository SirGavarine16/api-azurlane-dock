# Azur Lane Dock API

 This project was originally made using Next.js and deployed in Vercel, this is a React migration from that project. This is a small API developed with the sole purpose to serve the data that the React app will be using since the Azur Lane API wrapper throws an error related to fs and path module.

This app was developed by [Daniel De la Cruz](https://danieldelagavarain-dev.vercel.app/) using this [Azur Lane API](https://github.com/AzurAPI/azurapi-js#readme).
